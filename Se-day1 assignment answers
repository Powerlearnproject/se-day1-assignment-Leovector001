software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles,methods, and tools in the development and maintenance of high-quality software system. software engineering is important because it helps us in creating software that helps improve and power various aspects of modern life.
Development of programing languages(e.g Fortran,C),The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s,the establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s.
*Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.                        *Designs: Creating high level and detailed designs for the software.   *Implementation: Writing codes and and building the software according to specifications.                   *Testing: Conducting various tests to make sure the software meets qaulity standard and functional requirements.                        *Deployment: Releasing the software to customers and Customers           *Maintenance: providing ongoing supports, updates and enhancement after software deployment.
Agile methodologies focuses on flexibility, collaboration and response to changes while Waterfall focuses on Requirements,designs and implementation. for scenario Consider Agile if your project has dynamic requirements, needs frequent client feedback, and values adaptability.Choose Waterfall for projects with well-defined requirements, limited client involvement during development, and where a structured approach is necessary.
software developer: Responsible for writing codes and implementing software changes and solutions       *Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensure quality of software by designing and executing test plans.                *Project Manager: oversees planning, execution and delivery of software projects 
IDEs provides tools for writing,debugging and testing codes (e.g Visual studio, Eclipse etc). While VCS provides tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members (e.g Git, Subversion)
Changing Requirements, tight deadline and Technical Debt. The challenges can be overcomed by Edfective Communication,agile methodologies, prioritization of task,and regular assessment of projects goals and timelines.
Unit Testing: Tests individual components in isolation to verify they function correctly. It helps identify bugs early in development   *Integration Testing: Assesses combined components to ensure they work together as intended. It detects interface issues between modules.                             *System Testing: Evaluates the complete software system against requirements to ensure it meets functional and non-functional criteria. It simulates real-world usage scenarios                      *Acceptance Testing: Validates the software against business requirements before deployment, ensuring it meets user needs and is ready for production
promt engineering deals with crafting questions or statements to get the best possible answer from AI models. Interacting with AI is important because it enhances productivity, provides instant access to information, and enables personalized experiences tailored to individual needs.
Example of a Vague Prompt       "Tell me about the weather." Improved Prompt                 "Can you provide the current weather forecast for Lagos State for today?"                         Explanation of Improvement       The improved prompt is more effective because it specifies the location (Lagos State), the type of information requested (current weather forecast), and the time frame (for today). This clarity allows the AI to deliver precise and relevant information, reducing ambiguity and enhancing the user experience.
